## Introduction

Welcome to **ProteoGenius**, your future go-to tool for advanced proteomics data analysis. Our project is in its early stages, and we're on a mission to simplify and enhance the way researchers analyze proteomic data.

## Features

While our project is still in development, here are some of the exciting features we plan to implement:

- **Protein Identification:** Accurately identify proteins from mass spectrometry data.
- **Quantification:** Precisely quantify protein abundance using label-free and label-based methods.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Streamline data preprocessing for high-quality results.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Perform rigorous statistical analysis of your proteomics data.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive web-based interface makes analysis accessible.
- **Customization:** Tailor analysis pipelines to your research requirements.
- **Integration:** Access commonly used protein sequence databases for comprehensive analysis.
- **Data Export:** Easily export and share your results with colleagues.

Stay tuned for updates as we bring these features to life!

## Getting Started

As we're in the early stages of development, there's not much to get started with just yet. However, we're actively working on building the foundation for **ProteoGenius**.

## Contributing

We believe that collaboration is key to success, and we welcome contributions from the proteomics research community. While we're still setting up our contribution guidelines and code repository, you can express your interest by reaching out to us at [datadrivenbio@gmail.com](mailto:datadrivenbio@gmail.com).

## License

**ProteoGenius** is expected to be released under an open-source license. We're in the process of finalizing the licensing details, and the license information will be updated here once it's available.
